   )
3. Then put the weights into submission/Enkhbat/Topic1/script/data/yolov4.weights
4. Run save_model.py
5. Run detect.py (input the file into datasets/predict)
6. output in detections folder

If you want to me design the topic2 and topic3. ( I don't have GPU to run video but it is fairly simple. My laptop takes while to run)

# For Topic 2

I have completed the topic 2 but run only on first two videos out of 3 videos because my laptop is slow and no GPU, rendering video takes whole day. Next month I will get the new laptop so I could run faster. Even I could run the Topic 3 when I got faster laptop.
Also I have added the count text in courner of the video.
